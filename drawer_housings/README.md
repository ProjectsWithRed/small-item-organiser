# Drawer housings

- Here are all the `.stl` files for the different sized housings.
- `drawer_housing_x.stl`, where x is the number of drawers that housing can fit, `2` to `9`.
- If you need more than `9`, print two of size 5, etc.

# Important notes

- You can print all the housings without any supports, by printing it having the backside flat on the bed, bridging will take care of the rest.
- However, if your printer cannot do bridging very well, in the `/bottom_filled` directory you will find the exact same drawer housings with with the bottom filled in, so you can still print it with no support, and not worry about bridging.
