# Small item organiser

This repo is only used to host the 3D files for the small item organiser. There is a [video](https://youtu.be/E5vvo4CLFvw) showcasing and explaining the organiser.


## 3D models

- `/containers`, all the boxes/containers. It is up to you to choose which containers to print to meet your exact needs.
- `drawer_housing.stl`, the main and biggest part, this is where the drawers are inserted into.
- `drawer.stl`, you will need to print 5 drawers for a complete set. You can print less, but you will not have a full drawer set.
- `sliding_lid.stl`, this is optional, only needed if you want a lid for a drawer.
